# Liquidity-Pool-smart-contract
Contract Development: Developed two Solidity contracts — simpleErc20.sol (ERC20 token) and LiquidityPool.sol (liquidity pool contract) for managing token liquidity.

Foundry for Compilation: Used Foundry to compile Solidity contracts locally, ensuring contract code was correct and optimized before deployment.

ERC20 Token Deployment: Deployed the simpleErc20 ERC20 token contract on a testnet (Goerli/Rinkeby) using the Thirdweb platform.

Liquidity Pool Contract Deployment: Deployed the LiquidityPool contract using Thirdweb and passed the deployed ERC20 token address as a parameter for interaction.

Thirdweb for Deployment: Leveraged Thirdweb to deploy both contracts to the testnet, simplifying the deployment process with an easy-to-use interface.

Testnet Deployment: Deployed contracts to test networks to test and verify functionality before deploying to the Ethereum mainnet.

Interacting with Contracts: Utilized Thirdweb’s dashboard to monitor contract activity, check balances, and interact with deployed contracts easily.

Next Steps: After successful testnet deployment, consider mainnet deployment and frontend integration using thirdweb’s SDK to enable user interactions.
